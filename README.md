# Flatten-Array-By-One

Write a function that, when given an array with one or multiple nested arrays (arrayOfArrays), returns a new array with one less level of nesting.

All the elements of all the original nested arrays must be kept in their original order.

flattenArrayByOne([[1],[2],[3]]) //returns [1,2,3];

flattenArrayByOne([[1],[2],[[3,4]]]) //returns [1,2,[3,4]];
